Each class will delay the start of the animation by the amount of miliseconds it describes. So the class `.delay-100` will delay the start of the start of the animation by 100ms and `.duration-100` will __force__ the animation to have 100ms long.\r\n\r\nThis can be easily adjusted if you need less or more timming control (as you will see in the next section).\r\n\r\nTo use it, just add the corresponding classes to your elements, for instance:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"animate fadeInDown delay-1200\"> <!-- This will happen first -->\r\n  <h1 class=\"animate fadeInUp delay-1500\">This is a header</h1> <!-- This will happen 300ms after the div has appeared -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry it out in your css, or [see it in action](https://khaosdoctor.github.io/delay.css).\r\n\r\n### Building more timmings\r\n\r\nTo add or remove timmings from your customized version of this project, just go to the `src` folder and modify the file called `delay.scss`, on the lines:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@while $i < <the maximum time> {\r\n\r\n  $i: $i + <the hops>;\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs it uses Sass, you'll need to build it using your own sass compiler or running the gulpfile included in the project when you download it, just type `gulp` and it will create a `dist` folder with your alterations.\r\n\r\n## Wanna join the team?\r\n\r\nYeah!
